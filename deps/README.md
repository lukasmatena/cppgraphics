This directory contains scripts to download and build SDL2. The script is called
by the CMake scripts that are used to build the template projects in `projects/`
folder. See `projects/README.md` for details.


Alternatively, you can use the script to download and build SDL2 yourself. This
is hinted in `examples/manual_build/README.md`.
